If exe is called with < 3 cmd parameters, a new install is triggered. This value will have to be hardcode. By default it points to 
"http://www.wrmcodeblocks.com/TheTimeApp/Downloads". Would like to change this, but I don't want to have to have a .config file caried along besides the exe.


If exe is called with cmd parameters("CurrentVersionNum", "DownloadDirectory", "DownloadUrl"), updates are checked for on specified url 
against given app version.
